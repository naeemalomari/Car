          <p style="color:lightblue; font-size:15px;"> 
            Based on the recently redesigned 3-series sedan, the new 2021 BMW M3 successfully resurrects the nameplate's storied driver engagement. BMW shows its commitment to that sentiment by continuing to provide a manual transmission, at least on the regular model. An eight-speed automatic is mandatory on the more powerful M3 Competition. Behind their prominent, albeit polarizing, grille is a familiar twin-turbo 3.0-liter inline-six that makes between 473 and 503 horsepower. The latter is reserved for the aforementioned Competition variant, which will be offered with all-wheel drive for the first time, but not until the 2022 model year. Still, the 2021 M3 Competition further highlights the sports sedan's performance potential with track-ready hardware that should terrify rivals such as the Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio and Mercedes-AMG C63.

        <p style="color:white;

          The 2022 BMW M5 isn't a subdued sedan. It's an endless thrill ride on four wheels. Based on the regular BMW 5-series and amplified by the brand's M division, this four-door phenom features a twin-turbo V-8 that makes up to 627 horsepower and pushes the M5 to achieve heroic acceleration numbers. Helping in the blitz are its excellent automatic transmission and tenacious all-wheel-drive system, which includes a rear-drive mode for hanging the tail out. While the big-bodied sedan feels less agile than smaller models in BMW's portfolio of M cars, it has the athleticism and hardware to hold its own on a track. Plus, the 2022 M5's richly appointed interior will make any trip—be it to the road course or the lake house—enjoyable.

        <p style="color:white;

          Blending a tasteful yet aggressive design with extraordinary performance, the BMW M6 is a sexy beast indeed. Power comes from a 560-hp 4.4-liter twin-turbo V-8 mated to a seven-speed automatic or six-speed manual. One might not expect such brutish power in what is a comfortable and cosseting convertible, but that’s exactly why we like it. Despite being more agile than the 6-series, the steering and the brakes lack the feedback needed to make the M6 a proper sports car.</p>

      <li> <h1> BMW M8 </h1> </li> 
      <p style="color:grey;
      background:pink; font-size:15px;">
        With muscular proportions and massive power, the 2020 BMW M8 is a bully among boulevard cruisers. This badass Bimmer is based on the standard BMW 8-series—and is available as a coupe, convertible, and Gran Coupe that we review separately. Every version of the M8 boasts a mighty twin-turbo V-8 that pairs with a specialized all-wheel-drive system; it includes a rear-drive-only mode that's perfect for hanging the tail out. The M8 Competition model further maximizes performance with added horsepower, an enhanced chassis, and other bespoke bits. Despite its inherently aggressive demeanor, the M8 remains a pleasant daily driver. Its cabin is beautifully crafted and loaded with luxury features and desirable technology. While its exterior design won't appeal to extroverts, and BMW's newly introduced adjustable brake-pedal feel is unpleasant, the 2020 M8 is hugely capable and surprisingly comfortable.</p>
